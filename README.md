## Keywords - Face Recognition, PCA, Eigen Faces, LDA

## Team members
- Liew Zi Feng
- Andre Lim Tong En
- Yong Yung Jun
- Vikneswari A/P Perumal

## Dataset
- 400 images of 40 different individuals from Olivetti Dataset
- 60 images of 6 different individuals (Self Collect)

## Techniques used
- Feature Extraction using PCA & Eigen Faces
- Models: Linear Discriminant Analysis, Logistic regression, Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree & Convolutional Neural Network
- Model Evaluation using K-Fold Cross Validation & Leave-One-Out Cross Validation

## Results
- Linear Discriminant Analysis performed better than other models at accuracy 0.97 and 0.98 in both contexts with and without PCA.
